# OpenClassrooms - Python certification - Project #7

## Introduction
Algorithm Project : the objective of this project is to implement 2 algorithms to solve the Knapsack problem.

## Part 1: Brute Force Solution

The goal of this part is to provide an initial "brute force" solution that should generate the list of items to choose from a list of 20 elements.

## Part 2: Optimized Solution

This part requires implementing a second solution that can read a file containing items and propose the best possible combination.

It is also required to provide a set of slides containing the following:

- An analysis of the brute force algorithm.
- A diagram, flowchart, or pseudocode describing the thought process behind the optimized solution.
- The algorithm chosen for the optimized version and the algorithm's limitations (edge cases).
- A comparison of the efficiency and performance of the brute force algorithm versus the optimized algorithm using Big-O notation, time complexity, and memory analysis.
